# Churn-prediction-of-the-bank-customers.
Churn prediction for bank customers identifies those likely to leave, enabling targeted retention strategies to improve customer satisfaction and reduce turnover.


The project concerns churn prediction in the bank customers. Based on data we are going to try 
to predict whether the client is going to leave the bank or not by using information like credit 
score, tenure, salary, etc.
Churn is a term that means losing customers to the competition. A “Churned” customer is one 
who has cancelled their service and identification of such users beforehand can be invaluable 
from the company's point of view. It is very important because retain customers who want to 
leave us is in many cases much cheaper than acquiring new ones
